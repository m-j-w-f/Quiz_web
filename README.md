#### Link:  [Here](https://mo.pythonanywhere.com/login)
#### Description:
This is a small Quiz Website to check your basic knowledge.
More functionality will be added eventually.

## Basic Functionality
The basic flow is to select a category and a difficulty, which the is sent to [Open Trivia](https://opentdb.com). The answers are then shuffled and displayed.

## Translation
The Question can be translated into German. This is done by using the DeepL API.
If you want to see further detail on how this is done, check the file translate.py out.

## Scoring
A basic user database exists, however scores are not tracked (yet ðŸ˜‰).
This will probably be added in the future.
Also a Scoreboard displaying all the users would be a nice extension.

## New stuff
If you hava a great idea and want to exend this project, feel free to do so.
